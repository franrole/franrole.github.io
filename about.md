I am a ML teacher-researcher at Universit√© de Paris where my research mainly focus on text mining and unsupervised techniques. 
To know more about my favourite research themes, see  the following pages: [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/47/3852.html), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/role-francois-295a4112/?originalSubdomain=fr), [Coclust](https://pypi.org/project/coclust/), {% include icon-github.html username="franrole" %} /
[GitHub](https://github.com/franrole).

Besides research, I am curious about all aspects of Atifical Intelligence and Machine Learning.
